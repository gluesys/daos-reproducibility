## Client Nodes

The clients in TTA's MantaStorage system are ASUSTeK ESC8000-E11 servers,
currently running DAOS version 2.7 on Rocky Linux 9.6:

- CPU: 2x Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8558
- RAM: 16x 64GiB DDR5 Samsung 4800MT/s
- NIC: 2x Mellanox ConnectX-5 1-port Infiniband EDR adapter

## High-Performance Fabric

The HPC Fabric is a fully non-blocking HDR InfiniBand network, using
[Mellanox ????]() switch.

Both servers and clients use two single-port Mellanox ConnectX-6 HDR adapters
(one per CPU socket). On the servers, each port is managed by a dedicated
`daos_engine` running on that CPU socket. On the clients, each MPI task is
communicating through the IB interface on the same NUMA node.

## Execution Environment

All servers and clients were installed with the following software stack:

- Rocky Linux 9.6 (Kernel version 5.14.0-570.52.1.el9_6.x86_64)
- [MLNX_OFED_LINUX-24.10-3.2.5.0]() on the DAOS servers and clients.
- [DAOS 2.7](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/tree/69116f40fb3ec07ecd954618540a7d5318e6b5a8)
- [MPICH-4.2.3](https://www.mpich.org/downloads/)

The following DAOS server and client configuration files were used.

### DAOS Server configuration

- [/etc/daos/daos_server.yml](servers/MantaStorage-01/etc/daos/daos_server.yml)
- [/etc/daos/daos_control.yml](servers/MantaStorage-01/etc/daos/daos_control.yml)
- [/etc/daos/daos_agent.yml](servers/MantaStorage-01/etc/daos/daos_agent.yml)
- [/etc/sysctl.d/99-daos-net.conf](servers/MantaStorage-01/etc/sysctl.d/99-daos-net.conf)

For the IO500 benchmarks, one storage pool was created that spans all 4
servers, using the [create-pool.sh](servers/create-pool.sh) script. In that pool, a DAOS POSIX
container was created using the [create-cont.sh](servers/create-cont.sh) script.

### DAOS Client environment

Our IO500-SC25 benchmark runs were performend in the deployment stage, before
user operation started. For this reason the runs have been performed with
interactive `mpirun` invocations, using a hostlist to specify client nodes as
described above.

The IO500 run scripts are included in the IO500 results tarballs.

The rules for the IO500 Production lists require that the storage system has
no single point of failure. So the
[config-all-dfs-tmpl-rf1.ini](config-all-dfs-tmpl-rf1.ini) configuration file
has been used for Production runs. It protects against single faults by using
2-Way replication for metadata and IOR-Hard, and 2+1P Erasure Coding for IOR-Easy.

Submissions to the IO500 Research lists are using an itentical storage system
setup, but since the "no single point of failure" requirement does not apply
to the Research list the
[config-all-dfs-tmpl-rf0.ini](config-all-dfs-tmpl-rf0.ini) configuration file
has been used for Research runs. This configuration does not use replication
or Erasure Coding to maximize the achievable performance.
