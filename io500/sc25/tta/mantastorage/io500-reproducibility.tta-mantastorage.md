## Runtime Environment

> State here that you provided all scripts/documentation that would allow someone else to
> reproduce your environment and attempt to achieve a similar IO500 score as the submitted
> system.
>
> NOTE: provide all files/documentation/scripts that would enable a user to build your environment
> and deploy the custom scripts, software, or config files once they have obtained the appropriate
> storage system hardware and software. These may be included into the io500.tgz or into the
> extraCodes upload on the submission form.
> 
> Several examples include:
> 
> * Commands used to set striping information (either for the entire system or for particular
>   directories)
> * File system config and tuning information (or a reason why this is not available due to lack
>   of root access, etc) on each node type (e.g., non-default config parameters on all 3 Lustre
>   MDS, OSS, and client)
> * Any additional scripts utilized that impact IO500 execution beyond the io500 config file. For
>   example, with IBM Spectrum Scale, the output of config, cluster, file system and fileset
>   commands (and possibly even a dump of the configuration if possible). Each file system
>   probably has similar type of config/tuning information that would need to be shared for a

Full reproducibility documentation including the DAOS server configuration
files as well as client-side setup and run scripts is provided in the
daos-stack github repository: [https://github.com/daos-stack/daos-reproducibility/tree/master/io500/sc25/tta/mantastorage](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos-reproducibility/tree/master/io500/sc25/tta/mantastorage)

## Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

> Does your system have a single point of failure? Please describe all mechanisms provide fault
> tolerance for the submitted storage system. Be specific to your submission, not general storage
> system capabilities.
> 
> * Power
> * Networking (e.g., dual redundant switches)
> * Inter Storage data and metadata server (e.g., active-active servers, client-directed RAID,
>   declustered RAID, erasure-coding, 3-way replication)
> * Intra Storage data and metadata server storage media (e.g., raid5)
> 
> Please list any additional information needed to determine whether this system has a single point

DAOS is a scale-out software-defined storage system.

Hardware redundancy on the individual storage server level includes dual power supplies
(with redundant facility power feeds at the rack PUD level), and dual InfiniBand network interfaces
(typically attached to different InfiniBand leaf switches).
The servers used at TTA are also using memory DIMMs with ECC error detection and correction. 
All other redundancy features are provided in software.

The DAOS management service is redundant, with instances running on multiple DAOS servers.
Client access to the management plane is transparently redirected in case that individual DAOS servers fail.
There are no dedicated metadata servers.
Data placement is algorithmic, and declustered across all storage targets.

Contrary to traditional storage systems, a DAOS storage allocation (a DAOS _pool_) does not prescribe
any particular data protection level. It is only a raw storage allocation that is performed by the
storage administrator (or a job prolog).  
Data distribution and data protection is handled at the DAOS _container_ level.
A DAOS pool can host multiple containers, which share the storage allocation
but may employ different data distribution and data protection mechanisms. 

Container management is an end user role and does not require storage administrator intervention.
This means that end users are free to pick the appropriate level of data protection
for each of their datasets, on a per-container or even a per-object level. 
DAOS supports sharding/striping (redundancy factor rf=0), replication (2-way up to 5-way),
and network erasure coding (4+1P, 4+2P, 8+1P, 8+2P, 16+1P, 16+2P, etc.). 

**Regarding the IO500 rules**:

* DAOS submissions for the **Production** list use 2-Way replication for metadata and for IOR-Hard,
  and single-parity EC (here, 2+1P) for IOR-Easy,
  in order to satisfy the requirement of “no single point of failure”.
  The following DAOS object class settings are used in the io500.ini file for the Production list:

```
    [ior-easy]
    API = DFS --dfs.pool=tank --dfs.cont=posix_container --dfs.dir_oclass=RP_2G1 --dfs.oclass=EC_4P1GX
    [ior-hard]
    API = DFS --dfs.pool=tank --dfs.cont=posix_container --dfs.dir_oclass=RP_2G1 --dfs.oclass=RP_2GX --dfs.chunk_size=470080
    [mdtest-easy]
    API = DFS --dfs.pool=tank --dfs.cont=posix_container --dfs.dir_oclass=RP_2GX --dfs.oclass=RP_2G1
    [mdtest-hard]
    API = DFS --dfs.pool=tank --dfs.cont=posix_container --dfs.dir_oclass=RP_2GX --dfs.oclass=RP_2G1
```

* DAOS submissions for the **Research** list use sharding/striping (no data protection) for all tests,
  in order to achieve maximum performance.
  The following DAOS object class settings are used in the io500.ini file for the Research list:

```
    [ior-easy]
    API = DFS --dfs.pool=tank --dfs.cont=posix_conatiner --dfs.dir_oclass=S1 --dfs.oclass=SX
    [ior-hard]
    API = DFS --dfs.pool=tank --dfs.cont=posix_container --dfs.dir_oclass=S1 --dfs.oclass=SX --dfs.chunk_size=470080
    [mdtest-easy]
    API = DFS --dfs.pool=tank --dfs.cont=posix_container --dfs.dir_oclass=SX --dfs.oclass=S1
    [mdtest-hard]
    API = DFS --dfs.pool=tank --dfs.cont=posix_container --dfs.dir_oclass=SX --dfs.oclass=S1
```

Note that these choices are completely user-defined (as part of the API definitions in the IO500.ini file),
and have been executed on the **exact same** storage system configuration without intervention
of a storage administrator.

## Execution

> Please provide a description of how the IO500 benchmark was executed, e.g., via system scheduler
> (e.g., SLURM) to run a job on the compute cluster, which initially ran a setup process to configure
> the client and file system, and then started the full benchmark.

the IO500-SC25 runs were performed in the deployment stage of the MantaStorage
installation, before user operation started. For this reason the runs have been
performed with interactive `mpirun` invocations, using a `-hosts` options
specified by the `io500_mpiargs` environment variable in io500.sh

Full reproducibility documentation including the DAOS server configuration files as well as
client-side setup and run scripts is provided in the daos-stack github repository:  
[https://github.com/daos-stack/daos-reproducibility/tree/master/io500/sc25/tta/mantastorage](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos-reproducibility/tree/master/io500/sc25/tta/mantastorage)

> During the IO500 benchmark execution was the system entirely dedicated to running the
> benchmark or were there other jobs running in the same cluster and storage system?

Compute nodes and storage system were dedicated while running the benchmark.

## Caching

> Please describe all caching mechanisms in client/server that were utilized during the IO500 run.
> This could include caching in any storage medium (e.g., SSD, RAM).
> 
> A few examples would include:
> 
> * Client data/metadata caching (in Linux page cache or in other memory cache)
> * Client side NVMe read-only data cache
> * Storage server metadata/data caching in RAM
> * Storage controller caching
> * RAID card caching

The DAOS File System (DFS) API that was used for the IO500 runs does not
perform any caching.

## Data Source

> Where is the source of truth of the data stored and later read back in the IO500 benchmark? This
> question relates to whether the submitted system is a burst buffer layered on primary storage or
> primary storage itself.

DAOS is a standalone storage system,
and the DAOS POSIX container used in the IO500 benchmarks is the primary storage.

## Trust

> Please describe any steps taken to ensure that the results are trustworthy.
> 
> * Did you run the benchmark multiple times and get similar scores?
> * Did you validate the score is below the physical capabilities of the deployed hardware?
> * Did you validate that the data was persistently stored?

All runs have been repeated multiple times to ensure consistency.

All results have been reviewed for plausibility and are reasonable within the
hardware performance boundaries of the servers, clients, and HDR InfiniBand
network.

An in-depth performace sclaing study of IO500 workloads is also available in the
[SC-Asia 2023 paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3581576.3581577)
